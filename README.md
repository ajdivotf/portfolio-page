# portfolio-page

this is the implementation of the task from the freecodecamp course - responsive web design. 

there are inserted my own projects, which can be found on github. the color scheme of the graphics has been changed to match the color scheme of the page.

result is:

this page view is designed to be viewed on a mobile device

this kind of page is designed to be viewed on a computer

<img src="https://github.com/ajdivotf/portfolio-page/blob/main/results/big%20top.png" width="600"><img src="https://github.com/ajdivotf/portfolio-page/blob/main/results/big%20medium.png" width="600"><img src="https://github.com/ajdivotf/portfolio-page/blob/main/results/big%20bottom.png" width="600">

there are also effects that appear when you hover over the button and the names of the works. try it and find out.
